# SIM-UOW-CS
SIM UOW computer science cybersecurity + digital systems security

* 3 months = 1 sem
* 1 sem = 2 modules

Sem break during last 3 weeks of 3rd month. So actually there's enough time to do assignments



## CSCI251 : Advanced programming
Basically a C++ module that goes quite deep. NOT an introduction to C++ lol
- Assignment 1 - Allocating memory for array with new and delete
- Assginment 2 - Inheritance and polymorphism
- Assignment 3 - Generic programming with templates and operator overloading

Overall good module. I learnt a lot about C++. Mr Tian is good albeit a bit sexist lol. Just boomer things I guess. He provides his own learning materials outside of the module. Gives chance to students also. One thing I kinda disagree with, is the assignment difficulty. The main learning objectives of the assignments are listed above but a heavy bulk of the assignment also involves other complex (at least for me lol maybe I'm just a weak student) concepts such as printing an X Y grid in terminal, finding algorithm for coordinates within/ on shapes. I suppose this is to give us extra learning opportunities because I was introduced to ray casting algorithm. But these are core functionalities of the assignment program that's graded so these extra concepts being tested are out of scope. But uni don't need to score so high right so maybe it's no big deal actually lol.


## ISIT307 - Web server programming
Basically a basic php module
- Assignment 1 - simple php webpages
- Assignment 2 - simple php webpages with SQL

Overall bad module. To me, a web server should have at least MVC architecture but we weren't taught this at all. Instead, it's just front end php files talk to database directly. We were given a few weeks worth of lectures before finally having the first practical. I don't understand why lectures cover programming fundamentals like variables, operands, arrays etc.. Students entering this module already have programming background so why waste time. I was expecting my first lesson to be like "How to write a middleman php server with API" or something. Nope none of that was ever taught. And the MOST FRUSTRATING? During the assignment presentation, Dr Loo tests things outside of the assignment specification. He claims he mentioned them during his lessons. But there's no proof. No black and white. The Assignment requirements are so vague.


## CSCI235 - Database Systems
Intermediate database module using oracle db and mongo db
- Assignment 1 - functional dependency. A bit like maths
- Assignment 2 - PLSQL
- Assignment 3 - MongoDB

Overall dificult module. Maybe just for me lol. Covers quite a lot of concepts, but doesn't go too deep especially for mongo. I found it interesting that Oracle DB is used instead of the usual MySQL. I guess good opportunity to learn different database types. Mr Sionggo is not bad. He answers my questions. I was very taken aback when I started this module because the concept of functional dependency is quite complex. But I think towards the end of this module you should feel more confident with the concepts. I am a little critical of the mongo portion of this module though. From my understanding, Mongo is designed to be used in a cloud based microservices architecture. But this is not covered at all. I suppose because this would diverge into web development and design. One big sellinf point of Mongo, as compared to traditional SQL, is the cloud features like shards and clusters. So I feel this module is more of functional dependency with Oracle DB, and an introduction to Mongo DB. I think it's better to split the Mongo portion from this module. Mongo should be taught together with web design.


## CSIT302 - Cybersecurity
Introduction to Cybersecurity. Doesn't go deep or practical
woohoo only one assignment. Just research only

Overall easy module. The lecturer, Mr Partham, is EXTREMELY dry. His lectures suck. On the other hand, my tutor Mr Lionel, is much better. Took a glance at his linkedin and he's much more accredited than Mr Partha. Mr Lionel has a lot of real world working experience and he always shares with us his stories. Nothing much to say lah it's a simple module. I think there's another related module touch on the practical side of all the theory covered in this module.
