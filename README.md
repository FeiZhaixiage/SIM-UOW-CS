# SIM-UOW-CS
SIM UOW computer science cybersecurity + digital systems security
3 months = 1 sem
1 sem = 2 modules
sem break  during last 3 weeks of 3rd month

so actually there's enough time to do assignments

## CSCI251 : Advanced programming
Basically a C++ module that goes quite deep. NOT an introduction to C++ lol
- Assignment 1 - Allocating memory for array with new and delete
- Assginment 2 - Inheritance and polymorphism
- Assignment 3 - Generic programming with templates and operator overloading

Overall good module. I learnt a lot about C++. Mr Tian is good albeit a bit sexist lol. Just boomer things I guess. He provides his own learning materials outside of the module. Gives chance to students also. One thing I kinda disagree with, is the assignment difficulty. The main learning objectives of the assignments are listed above but a heavy bulk of the assignment also involves other complex (at least for me lol maybe I'm just a weak student) concepts such as printing an X Y grid in terminal, finding algorithm for coordinates within/ on shapes. I suppose this is to give us extra learning opportunities because I was introduced to ray casting algorithm. But these are core functionalities of the assignment program that's graded so these extra concepts being tested are out of scope. But uni don't need to score so high right so maybe it's no big deal actually lol.


## ISIT307 - Web server programming
Basically a basic php module
- Assignment 1 - simple php webpages
- Assignment 2 - simple php webpages with SQL

Overall bad module. To me, a web server should have at least MVC architecture but we weren't taught this at all. Instead, it's just front end php files talk to database directly. We were given a few weeks worth of lectures before finally having the first practical. I don't understand why lectures cover programming fundamentals like variables, operands, arrays etc.. Students entering this module already have programming background so why waste time. I was expecting my first lesson to be like "How to write a middleman php server with API" or something. Nope none of that was ever taught. And the MOST FRUSTRATING? During the assignment presentation, Dr Loo tests things outside of the assignment specification. He claims he mentioned them during his lessons. But there's no proof. No black and white. The Assignment requirements are so vague.
