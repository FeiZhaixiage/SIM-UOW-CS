# SIM-UOW-CS
SIM UOW computer science cybersecurity + digital systems security

* 3 months = 1 sem
* 1 sem = 2 modules

Sem break during last 3 weeks of 3rd month. So actually there's enough time to do assignments



## CSCI251 : Advanced programming
Basically a C++ module that goes quite deep. NOT an introduction to C++ lol
- Assignment 1 - Allocating memory for array with new and delete
- Assginment 2 - Inheritance and polymorphism
- Assignment 3 - Generic programming with templates and operator overloading

Overall good module. I learnt a lot about C++. Mr Tian is good albeit a bit sexist lol. Just boomer things I guess. He provides his own learning materials outside of the module. Gives chance to students also. One thing I kinda disagree with, is the assignment difficulty. The main learning objectives of the assignments are listed above but a heavy bulk of the assignment also involves other complex (at least for me lol maybe I'm just a weak student) concepts such as printing an X Y grid in terminal, finding algorithm for coordinates within/ on shapes. I suppose this is to give us extra learning opportunities because I was introduced to ray casting algorithm. But these are core functionalities of the assignment program that's graded so these extra concepts being tested are out of scope. But uni don't need to score so high right so maybe it's no big deal actually lol.


## ISIT307 - Web server programming
Basically a basic php module
- Assignment 1 - simple php webpages
- Assignment 2 - simple php webpages with SQL

Overall bad module. To me, a web server should have at least MVC architecture but we weren't taught this at all. Instead, it's just front end php files talk to database directly. We were given a few weeks worth of lectures before finally having the first practical. I don't understand why lectures cover programming fundamentals like variables, operands, arrays etc.. Students entering this module already have programming background so why waste time. I was expecting my first lesson to be like "How to write a middleman php server with API" or something. Nope none of that was ever taught. And the MOST FRUSTRATING? During the assignment presentation, Dr Loo tests things outside of the assignment specification. He claims he mentioned them during his lessons. But there's no proof. No black and white. The Assignment requirements are so vague.


## CSCI235 - Database Systems
Intermediate database module using oracle db and mongo db
- Assignment 1 - functional dependency. A bit like maths
- Assignment 2 - PLSQL
- Assignment 3 - MongoDB

Overall dificult module. Maybe just for me lol. Covers quite a lot of concepts, but doesn't go too deep especially for mongo. I found it interesting that Oracle DB is used instead of the usual MySQL. I guess good opportunity to learn different database types. Mr Sionggo is not bad. He answers my questions. I was very taken aback when I started this module because the concept of functional dependency is quite complex. But I think towards the end of this module you should feel more confident with the concepts. I am a little critical of the mongo portion of this module though. From my understanding, Mongo is designed to be used in a cloud based microservices architecture. But this is not covered at all. I suppose because this would diverge into web development and design. One big selling point of Mongo, as compared to traditional SQL, is the cloud features like shards and clusters. So I feel this module is more of functional dependency with Oracle DB, and an introduction to Mongo DB. I think it's better to split the Mongo portion from this module. Mongo should be taught together with web design.


## CSIT302 - Cybersecurity
Introduction to Cybersecurity. Doesn't go deep or practical
woohoo only one assignment. Just research only

Overall easy module. The lecturer, Mr Partham, is EXTREMELY dry. His lectures suck. On the other hand, my tutor Mr Lionel, is much better. Took a glance at his linkedin and he's much more accredited than Mr Partha. Mr Lionel has a lot of real world working experience and he always shares his stories with us. Nothing much to say lah it's a simple module. I think there's another related module touch on the practical side of all the theory covered in this module.


## CSIT375 - AI for cybersecurity
I don't even know if I can call this an introduction to AI...
One assignment, one quiz. But the "quiz" is more like an assignment. So I'll say 2 assignments essentially

This module touches on very deep and complex concepts about AIML. Our lecturer Dr Wei Zong seems like the real deal. I think he studied in UOW and did a phd in AI or something. Interesting to see that he references his own work in the lecture slides. Whenever he brings up a new concept, he often expands on it until he says that it is out of scope of the module. He even knows some controversy within the AIML community that he included in it the lecture slides lol. I think he really is an expert in the AIML field.
And with Dr Wei Zog's expertise, also means the content is very complex. Almost every lesson I couldn't catch what is going on. It got much better when we did the lab tutorials where we had to manually calculate things like linear regression, ID3, SVM, gaussian distribution etc... 
Interesting topics really, and he does explain the application of AIML in cybersecurity. My skeptic side is telling me that the course heads just wanted some form of AI being taught included in the course so they shoe horned this module. Actually we were supposed to take CSCI301 or something... an IoT module or something but all of a sudden I was notified that the module will change. I feel this is not right at all because the school is literally not complying with the terms of our PEI contract. We paid money for this agreed set of modules but they just changed it?? Whatever, I am so done with trying to talk to the course heads. They do not reply.

## CSCI369 - Ethical Hacking
Light introduction and light hands-on on cybersecurity
one assignmenmt, 3 open book quizes

For context I took CEH and I felt it was a decent measure of baseline knowledge of cybersecurity. This entire course basically has 2 modules on cybersecurity. CSIT302 - Cybersecurity and this CSCI369 - Ethical Hacking. They are maybe 60% of what's covered in CEH. It's too light! However my tutor, Mr Zong Fu, is very good. He is one of the heads at Ensign. He always shares stories and links the things taught, to his real world consulting experience. I don't have much to talk about this module. Simple. It made me realise that this course is ultimately a computer science course primarily, with just a sprinkle of cybersecurity.
