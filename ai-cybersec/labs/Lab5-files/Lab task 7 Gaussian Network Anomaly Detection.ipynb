    "# Gaussian distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick recap, let us review some characteristics of the Gaussian distribution. In mathematical terms, the Gaussian distribution (also known as the normal distribution) represents a probability distribution of random variables, which takes the following mathematical form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mu$ represents the average, and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance (which is representative of the variability of the data around the average value). In its standard form, the mean $\\mu$ assumes the value of 0, and $\\sigma^2$ assumes the value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of the Gaussian distribution is the central limit theorem, which, in general terms, establishes that the average of the observational data of a random variable—extracted independently—converges to the normal value as the number of observations increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the observations, as their number increases, are distributed symmetrically (and with greater probability) around the mean $\\mu$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Normal_Distribution_pdf.png\" style=\"width:400px;height:250px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While they deviate from the average value (tending to be distributed in the left and right extremities) for increasing values of $\\sigma$, the normal distribution is therefore adequately represented by the values assumed by $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, it is possible to determine the probability with which the observations are distributed around the average value, in proportion to the value of the variance; in other words, we can determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 68% of observations fall within the range between $\\mu - \\sigma$ and $\\mu + \\sigma$.\n",
    "- 95% of observations fall within the range between $\\mu - 2\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 2\\sigma$.\n",
    "- 99.7% of observations fall within the range between $\\mu - 3\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 3\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical rule, also referred to as the three-sigma rule or 68-95-99.7 rule, is a statistical rule which states that for a normal distribution, almost all observed data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean or average.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anomaly detection using the Gaussian distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian distribution can be used to identify the outliers. The anomaly element consists of a significant difference assumed by the outliers with respect to the rest of the data. The more the majority of the data is firmly concentrated around the mean value $\\mu$ with a low variance $\\sigma$, the more significant the anomalous value assumed by the outlier is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Gaussian distribution in anomaly detection, we will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that the features of the training set are normally distributed (this can also be verified intuitively from the visual analysis of plotted data)\n",
    "2. Estimate the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ values, representative of the distribution\n",
    "3. Choose an adequate threshold, representative of the probability that the observations are anomalous\n",
    "4. Assess the reliability of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we will show an implementation of Gaussian anomaly detection."

In the case of IDS based on signatures, the risk of error is represented by the high number of false negatives, that is, attacks that are not detected.
