goal of cybersecurity

1. secrecy
- cryptography and access control

2. confidentiality
- protecting organisational secrets

3. privacy
- protecting secrets of individual. Involves individual information








threat landscape: all possible vectors of attack



when using outsourced services, need to check SLA (service level agreement) if security requirements are met



NIST incidence response process
1. preparation
	- implement security controls ie. WAF

2. detection & analysis
	- IDS
	- identify IOC (indicators of compromise)

3. containment, eradication & recovery
	- isolate compromised network
	- remove malware
	- return systems back online
	> threat lifecycle management (expansion of this pt3 segment)
		- forensic data collection
			- collect logs
		- discovery
			- automatic scans with antivirus
		- qualification
			- remove false positives
		- investigation
			- check for damage
		- neutralisation
			- remove malware
		- recovery
			- bring systems back online

4. post-incident activity
	- documentation
	- timeline of incident
	- keep evidence











lockheed martin cybersec kill chain
1. external recon
	- non intrusive and intrusive
	- internal recon (performed on site)
	- open source
	- dumpster diving
	- spoofing, phishing
	- water hole (infect popular website)
	- 6 levers of social engineering
		1. reciprocation
		2. scarcity
		3. consistency
		4. liking
		5. authority
		6. validation


2. compromise system
3. lateral movement
	- gaining access to more nodes within the same security access

4. privilege escalation
5. conclude	









purpose of security policy
uphold
C - CONFIDENTIALITY
I - INTEGRITY
A - AVAILABILITY



security policy should be less technical so everyone can understand


endpoints: devices that consume info ie. phone , laptop


NAC - network access control
> controls traffic between endpoints

firewall: gatekeep allowed connection between inside and outside the network


AZURE SECURITY CENTER



cost/ profit analysis (aka business impact analysis)
- balancing the cost of disruption vs cost of recovery



insurance ?




COMPONENTS OF DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN
1.
2
3




recovery plan and incident response plan should constantly be evaluated and updated to cover new attack vectors or threats


5 steps of contigency plan planning
1
2
3
4
5




redundancy, fault tolerance

EXAM will test the REVISION portion of slide 6-2



*** NO NEED CARE ABOUT HYBRID CLOUD. SEE LECTURE RECORDING 20 APRIL












PEOPLE PROCESS TECH






Shadow IT: IT that an employee uses without IT dept's approval



Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC): the time from start of job to successful compromise of target system

Mean Time to Privilege Escalation (MTTPE): the time from start of job to root access of target system





broken authentication: when authentication systems have a flaw, allowing attackers to impersonate valid users or steal keys


IDOR: insecure direct object reference
an exploit where an attacker accesses a certain node through alternate routes originally intended

ie.

force to view admin page throrugh URL. amazon.com/admin






--------------------------------------



CII: crticial infra

CCOP: look up !!!


---------------------------------


pentest vs red team

pentest: got permission

red team: no permission




cyber threat intel: intelligence vs information
intel is info, but with has details on how to act on the information




for tutorial 2, see slide day2-2, page 32








_________________


policy vs standard

- policy is usually more high level and not so detailed
- standard is more detailed and technical


ie
set strong password is policy
set alphanumeric is standard




behaviour based detection solves the problem of zero day attacks

cybersec goals
secrecy: access control to info
conf: protect secrets
privacy: protect personal info

shadow IT: systems used by staff but unknown to IT dept

Mean Time to Compromise + Mean Time to Privilege Escalation

NIST IR phases
1. preparation
implement security controls ie. WAF
2. detection
IDS + identify IOC
3. containment
isolate compromised network
remove malware
return systems back online

5. post
documentation
timeline of incident
keep evidence

BYOD issues
insecure BYOD device
no BYOD policy

6 levers
reciprocation
scarcity
consistency
liking
authority
validation

broken auth
URL traversal
nvr log out properly. pw still in session

red team strat
WHO: profile threats. who will benefit from attack
WHAT: study attack types
HOW: define mission

policy vs standard
pol not detailed, stand is technical. set pw vs set alphanum
both must enforce by body

parts of policy
policy: expectations
stands: detailed
procs: how things are done
guidel: best prac

MAC attack
attacker flood MAC table with invalid MAC addr. switch will send packets to invalid addr
set limit to prevent this

DHCP Snooping
prevents invalid DHCP used in network

ARP spoofing
change ARP table to hold invalid MAC table
use firewall to prevent

traditional vs new defender
trad. monitor high profile only. new monitor all

IOC
artifact that proves intrusion

IDS
monitor system or network and trigger alert

IPS
IDS but performs corrective action

benefit of UEBA
proactive measures. can detect 0 day

VLAN
subnetwork. mitigate lat move

defence in depth
not 2x AV. use multiple types ie firewall, AV, SAST

purpose of CTI
profile attackers

types of CTI
opr: news
tactical: more deets, info on immediate threats
strat: for decision makers

benefit of DRP
business cont, low downtime
data protection
customer trust
compliance wtih standards

DRP planning process
form team, document assets, VAPT, prioritise process and assets, create plan, test, monitor

DRP vs BCP
DRP low downtime, recover IT
BCP maintain business opr 

business impact analysis (BIA)
consequences of disruption

5 phases of vuln mngmt
create asst invtry
- identify what needs to be protected
- easier patching
plan info mngmt
- network sec, data sec, 0 trust
VA 
- scope
- collect data
- analyse existing policies
- VAPT scan
- CTI
- accetable risks
= cost benefit ratio
= std compliance
= likelihood
report and remediation tracking
- good for management
- staff compliance issue
response plan
- identify jurisdiction

GDPR principles
data minimisation
CIA: unlawful loss or modification
accountability: why is info being collected. record data processing

GDPR indv rights
right to access: subject access request: find what info the org has on u
erasure: most complex. cant verify. too many strings. 
restrict auto processing
data portability: can share with other services
object

GDPR is EU only or when client is EU

Double extortion: encrypt data and steal it

GDPR must have data protec offcr

no GDPR fine
no person data
timely proper resp
compliance
unavoidable

why ISO27001
legal compliance
higher revenue
lower cost from attacks

why not ISO
downtime
expensive
not for small org

how ISO work
risk mngmt
cont monitor
IR

NIST CSF
identify: assets =hard
protect: safeguards =easy
detect: IDS
respond: IR
recover: DRP
