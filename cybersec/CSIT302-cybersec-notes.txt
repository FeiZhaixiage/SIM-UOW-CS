goal of cybersecurity

1. secrecy
- cryptography and access control

2. confidentiality
- protecting organisational secrets

3. privacy
- protecting secrets of individual. Involves individual information








threat landscape: all possible vectors of attack



when using outsourced services, need to check SLA (service level agreement) if security requirements are met



NIST incidence response process
1. preparation
	- implement security controls ie. WAF

2. detection & analysis
	- IDS
	- identify IOC (indicators of compromise)

3. containment, eradication & recovery
	- isolate compromised network
	- remove malware
	- return systems back online
	> threat lifecycle management (expansion of this pt3 segment)
		- forensic data collection
			- collect logs
		- discovery
			- automatic scans with antivirus
		- qualification
			- remove false positives
		- investigation
			- check for damage
		- neutralisation
			- remove malware
		- recovery
			- bring systems back online

4. post-incident activity
	- documentation
	- timeline of incident
	- keep evidence











lockheed martin cybersec kill chain
1. external recon
	- non intrusive and intrusive
	- internal recon (performed on site)
	- open source
	- dumpster diving
	- spoofing, phishing
	- water hole (infect popular website)
	- 6 levers of social engineering
		1. reciprocation
		2. scarcity
		3. consistency
		4. liking
		5. authority
		6. validation


2. compromise system
3. lateral movement
	- gaining access to more nodes within the same security access

4. privilege escalation
5. conclude	









purpose of security policy
uphold
C - CONFIDENTIALITY
I - INTEGRITY
A - AVAILABILITY



security policy should be less technical so everyone can understand


endpoints: devices that consume info ie. phone , laptop


NAC - network access control
> controls traffic between endpoints

firewall: gatekeep allowed connection between inside and outside the network


AZURE SECURITY CENTER



cost/ profit analysis (aka business impact analysis)
- balancing the cost of disruption vs cost of recovery



insurance ?




COMPONENTS OF DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN
1.
2
3




recovery plan and incident response plan should constantly be evaluated and updated to cover new attack vectors or threats


5 steps of contigency plan planning
1
2
3
4
5




redundancy, fault tolerance

EXAM will test the REVISION portion of slide 6-2



*** NO NEED CARE ABOUT HYBRID CLOUD. SEE LECTURE RECORDING 20 APRIL












PEOPLE PROCESS TECH






Shadow IT: IT that an employee uses without IT dept's approval



Mean Time to Compromise (MTTC): the time from start of job to successful compromise of target system

Mean Time to Privilege Escalation (MTTPE): the time from start of job to root access of target system





broken authentication: when authentication systems have a flaw, allowing attackers to impersonate valid users or steal keys


IDOR: insecure direct object reference
an exploit where an attacker accesses a certain node through alternate routes originally intended

ie.

force to view admin page throrugh URL. amazon.com/admin






--------------------------------------



CII: crticial infra

CCOP: look up !!!


---------------------------------


pentest vs red team

pentest: got permission

red team: no permission




cyber threat intel: intelligence vs information
intel is info, but with has details on how to act on the information




for tutorial 2, see slide day2-2, page 32








_________________


policy vs standard

- policy is usually more high level and not so detailed
- standard is more detailed and technical


ie
set strong password is policy
set alphanumeric is standard




behaviour based detection solves the problem of zero day attacks
