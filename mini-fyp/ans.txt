aggregation
	empty diamond
	point to parent
	parent and child can exist independently

	filled diamond
	point to parent
	parent exists if child dies. child dies if parent dies

inheritance

B
	handles interaction between user and system

C
	handles interaction between B and E
	enforces business rules

E
	handles interaction to DB


7.
incremental checks instead of lump sum
simpler debugging
ensures everything works

- use VCS
- automated stages 
- small frequent commits
- use ci server
- minimise build time
- test in testing environment. Deploy to production environment when ready
