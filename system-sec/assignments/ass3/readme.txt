This is the readme.txt for my assignment 3 program

The main app is ids.py. It requires an Events.txt and a Stats.txt
File name is dynamic but the contents must follow the same format as outlined in assignment specification

ids.py
Events.txt
Stats.txt

These 3 files must be in the same directory

ids.py requires these dependencies
numpy
matplotlib

to install,
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib

to run the app,
python ids.py Events.txt Stats.txt 2

run time may not be instant because of graph generation
